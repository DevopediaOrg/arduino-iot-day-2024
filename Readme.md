**Organized by Devopedia Foundation**<br>**23 March @ Bangalore**<br><br><br>

## Overview

Arduino Day 2024 is an event celebrated worldwide. Official dates are 21-23 March. See https://days.arduino.cc/about. Arduino as an embedded platform started in 2005. The first Arduino Day was organized on 29th March 2014. Since then the event has been held every year. It's an event where people meet to share their Arduino projects, learn new stuff and exchange ideas. Beginners get inspired to take up more challenging projects. Experts get a chance to tell their stories!

Devopedia's event is not limited to Arduino boards. Some demos will use Raspberry Pi, MSP430 LaunchPad, NodeMcu, etc. This event is not just for IoT experts. Even beginners are given a platform to demo simple projects and learn from others. Almost all demos will feature open source components. Devopedia will share sufficient details of each demo so that visitors can go back and try them out on their own. Remote participants will share their demos as pre-recorded videos, which we'll play at the venue.


## Demos

This repository shares sufficient details of each demo so that others can try them out on their own. Following are the projects to be demonstrated:

| [Playing any Carnatic raga using only white keys of keyboard](Configurable-Music-Keyboard) | Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toerxPBxZXk<br><br>A music keyboard has 12 keys per octave; 7 white keys and 5 black keys. Every Carnatic music Raga uses just seven out these twelve keys. There are exceptions, of course, where a raga can use more than seven. But here we are concerned with those which use only seven. For example, the raga Shankarabharana uses all seven white keys while the raga Kalyani uses six white keys and one black key. It is difficult for a beginner to remember which keys are to be used for which Raga. It takes a long time before one can become proficient with the keys to be used for every raga. It becomes a much bigger problem if the Shruti is to be changed according to the vocalist.<p>The basic keyboard has a certain default assignment of notes to each key. What I do is to re-assign those notes depending on the Raga.<p>When a key is pressed on the keyboard, a set of data is sent out through the MIDI interface. The data contains info about which key and what velocity with which it was struck, etc. I use Arduino to receive this data and change the note depending on the selected raga and send it back to the keyboard. This data then passes on the music generating section of the keyboard. So, instead of hearing the default note of the key, you hear the modified note.<p>The Raga selection is conveyed to the Arduino through serial port commands.<p>I use an android phone to connect to the Arduino. It serves the dual purpose of powering the Arduino as well as communicating with the Serial port.<p>I also have a Bluetooth interface for wireless communication but then the Arduino has to be powered separately. | **K. P. Sundararajan**<br>Hobbyist  & Tinkerer |
