**Organized by Devopedia Foundation**<br>**23 March @ Bangalore**<br><br><br>

## Overview

Arduino Day 2024 is an event celebrated worldwide. Official dates are 21-23 March. See https://days.arduino.cc/about. Arduino as an embedded platform started in 2005. The first Arduino Day was organized on 29th March 2014. Since then the event has been held every year. It's an event where people meet to share their Arduino projects, learn new stuff and exchange ideas. Beginners get inspired to take up more challenging projects. Experts get a chance to tell their stories!

Devopedia's event is not limited to Arduino boards. Some demos will use Raspberry Pi, MSP430 LaunchPad, NodeMcu, etc. This event is not just for IoT experts. Even beginners are given a platform to demo simple projects and learn from others. Almost all demos will feature open source components. Devopedia will share sufficient details of each demo so that visitors can go back and try them out on their own. Remote participants will share their demos as pre-recorded videos, which we'll play at the venue.


## Demos

This repository shares sufficient details of each demo so that others can try them out on their own. Following are the projects to be demonstrated:

| [Playing any Carnatic raga using only white keys of keyboard](Configurable-Music-Keybaord) | A music keyboard has 12 keys per octave; 7 white keys and 5 black keys. Every Carnatic music Raga uses just seven out these twelve keys. There are exceptions, of course, where a raga can use more than seven. But here we are concerned with those which use only seven. For example, the raga Shankarabharana uses all seven white keys while the raga Kalyani uses six white keys and one black key. It is difficult for a beginner to remember which keys are to be used for which Raga. It takes a long time before one can become proficient with the keys to be used for every raga. It becomes a much bigger problem if the Shruti is to be changed according to the vocalist.<p>The basic keyboard has a certain default assignment of notes to each key. What I do is to re-assign those notes depending on the Raga.<p>When a key is pressed on the keyboard, a set of data is sent out through the MIDI interface. The data contains info about which key and what velocity with which it was struck, etc. I use Arduino to receive this data and change the note depending on the selected raga and send it back to the keyboard. This data then passes on the music generating section of the keyboard. So, instead of hearing the default note of the key, you hear the modified note.<p>The Raga selection is conveyed to the Arduino through serial port commands.<p>I use an android phone to connect to the Arduino. It serves the dual purpose of powering the Arduino as well as communicating with the Serial port.<p>I also have a Bluetooth interface for wireless communication but then the Arduino has to be powered separately. | K.

| [Ambient light sensing and LCD display](LDR-LCD-2x16) | Using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) we sense the ambient lighting level. This is displayed on an LCD in terms of voltage and resistance. This demo is with TI MSP430F5529 LaunchPad but it can be with Arduino Uno as well. See the code for which pins of the Arduino Uno to use. Some concepts learned in this demo:<br>- Analog input<br>- Voltage divider concept<br>- To simplify interfacing to the LCD, we use the LiquidCrystal library: https://github.com/arduino-libraries/LiquidCrystal | Hardhik | 10th standard student |
| [Ambient temperature sensing and display with LM35, 7-segment LEDs and 74HC595](LM35-7Segx3) | Using LM35 sensor we read the ambient temperature. We display this on three 7-segment LEDs. To reduce the number of wires from controller board to LEDs, we use a shift register. We light up one LED at a time, thus minimizing current draw. We use only one resistor on the common cathode terminal. We show this demo with TI MSP430F5529 LaunchPad but we're including the wiring connections for Arduino Uno as well. | Siddharth | 10th standard student |
| [FM receiver on Raspberry Pi using GNU Radio](SDR-WBFM-RX-RPI) | GNU Radio is an open source platform for signal processing. It can be used to implement software-defined radio (SDR) projects. In this project, we take an SDR approach to building an FM receiver on Raspberry Pi. GNU Radio is a wonderful learning platform for students of signal processing. We can change the parameters of different parts of the receiver and study how these affect the quality of the audio.<p>For this project, any 64-bit Raspberry Pi version can be used. Any display or speaker can be used. We used the following:<br>- Raspberry Pi 5 with 8 GB RAM and 8 GB SD card: https://devopedia.org/raspberry-pi<br>- Power supply adapter for Raspberry Pi<br>- OS: (a) PiSDR used in this demo: https://github.com/luigifcruz/pisdr-image (b) Dragon OS is an alternative: https://cemaxecuter.com/<br>- BalenaEtcher to load the OS image on the Raspberry Pi: https://www.balena.io/etcher/<br>- GNU Radio Companion, v3.10.9.0-rc1 (comes pre-installed with PiSDR)<br>- NooElec (an RTL-SDR cousin) with antenna: https://www.amazon.in/NooElec-USB-Stick-RTL2832U-R820T/dp/B009U7WZCA<br>- HDMI video capture device to interface to Nexus Android tablet: https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0BK1KG825/<br>- Asus Google Nexus 7 tablet for display: https://www.gsmarena.com/asus_google_nexus_7-4850.php<br>- Tribit Bluetooth speaker (since audio on the Nexus tablet is weak for the demo)<br>- USB Camera Android app on Nexus tablet: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shenyaocn.android.usbcamera&hl=en&gl=US<br>- Necessary connectors, cables and adapters | Arvind Padmanabhan | Founder Trustee at Devopedia Foundation.

| [AI speech recognition with TensorFlow Lite](SpeechRecognition-SparkfunEdge) | Using the following hardware, we will showcase a speech detector on a microcontroller:<br>- Linux computer<br>- SparkFun Edge board contains a Apollo3 Blue microcontroller<br>- USB-to-Serial adapter based on the CH340C and USB-C<p>The AI model on the board is trained to recognize the words "yes" and "no". It communicates its results by lighting colored LEDs. | Meenakshi S | Meenakshi is a principal cloud tech professional at Sumeru software solutions, with abiding interest in AI. A couple of applications she has worked on 1) Devopedia's Named Entity Recognizer and 2) Re-engineering Deformable Convolution Model in TensorFlow (presented at Google). |
| [Garage door monitoring system](Garage-Door-Monitoring) | The project utilizes three main hardware components: ESP8266, PIR sensor, and a motor. The system is designed to automatically open the door in response to detected motion using the PIR sensor. Additionally, control over the door is facilitated through the Blynk dashboard, where users can manually open and close the door according to their requirements. This setup allows for both automated and manual operation of the door, providing flexibility and convenience for users. | Pari Agarwal<br><br>Shibadri Mukherjee<br><br>Rashi Dubey<br><br>Nibin Varughese Alex | We are students of Christ (Deemed to be University), pursuing B.Tech CSE in our pre-final year. We have done this project as a part of our coursework. Our project domain is automated garage door system. Our interest lies in the field of artificial intelligence and automation. |
