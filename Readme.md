**Organized by Devopedia Foundation**<br>**23 March @ Bangalore**<br><br><br>

## Overview

Arduino Day 2024 is an event celebrated worldwide. Official dates are 21-23 March. See https://days.arduino.cc/about. Arduino as an embedded platform started in 2005. The first Arduino Day was organized on 29th March 2014. Since then the event has been held every year. It's an event where people meet to share their Arduino projects, learn new stuff and exchange ideas. Beginners get inspired to take up more challenging projects. Experts get a chance to tell their stories!

Devopedia's event is not limited to Arduino boards. Some demos will use Raspberry Pi, MSP430 LaunchPad, NodeMcu, etc. This event is not just for IoT experts. Even beginners are given a platform to demo simple projects and learn from others. Almost all demos will feature open source components. Devopedia will share sufficient details of each demo so that visitors can go back and try them out on their own. Remote participants will share their demos as pre-recorded videos, which we'll play at the venue.
